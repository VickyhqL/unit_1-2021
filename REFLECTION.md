##Q1:
Planning, designing, developing, evaluating and implementing

##Q2: 
To make measureable goals to base your progress and results upon. Help you keep in mind what you need to do while creating a product. To see if you meet the needs of the client.

##Q3: 
Almost everything. I now know what functions are and what for loops are. I also know what while loops are and if/else. However I still cannot comphrehend flow diagrams, they make no sense to me. But I went from knowing nothing to knowing the very basics of python so I count that as progress. I didn't know we had to "cheat" so musch in class and how it was commonplace to do so.

##Q4: 
I understand that I cna't really visualise my thought process and also I cna't remeber shapes because I struggle to remeber what shape means what in flow diagrams and they confuse me more than writing in prose. I'm also not very good at estimating how much time I have and how much I can do.

##Q5: 
I think I planned well for the project. I really liked the idea of the game and the story kept me working when I wanted to rest. Although I didn't always finish task as fast as I hoped.

##Q6: 
The thing that didn't work well for me was timing. I had no clue how to estimate the time I needed to finish my project. I also forgot to do the justifications of my used program and my success criterion weren't successful enough. I also had no motivation to finish things and as such worked really slowly. I had issues with flow diagrams where I kept getting confused and restarting and wasted alot of time.

##Q8: 
I don't think that the developer is responsible beyond achieving the success criteria. IF they choose to conintue beyond that it will be their own choice, not obligation. When you commission a painter, you gove them criteria and they try to create to the best of their ability. You can't just not pay them if you think is is not satisfactory. In the same way a programmer simply has to create a program that meets the criteria, beyond that it is hard for them to know the nuances that you want to see in the product. When you give a developer success criteria, you are telling them what you want, if you neglect to tell them what you want and then want them to change things after achieving those criteria, it is not their fault. I'm not saying a developer can't make a objectively bad program out of your criteria, just that once they acomplish the task of meeting those criteria there is no longer a responsibilty on them. If you need improvements you can always find the creator and ask them to change it but they are not obligated to do it for you.
